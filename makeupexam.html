      <li><b>You will have 5 hours to complete the assignment.  The assignment is actually 4 hours, but an extra hour has been added to cover potential problems, 
        allow for uploading and capturing a screen shot of the submission confirmation page (if needed).</b></li>
      <li>Filename: <b>ExamLastname.cpp (where Lastname is your last name i.e. ExamSmith.cpp).</b> Incorrect file names will count as <u>1 minor error</u>.</li>
      <li>Submit your source code file <b>only</b> (This is the file with the ".cpp" extension - NOT the ".exe" file).</li>
      <li>This exam covers concepts in <b>Chapters 2-7</b> only. The use of advanced code from other Chapters in the book will count as a <u>major error</u>.</li>

    <h3>Program Description</h3>
    <p>You have been hired by the local news station that will help meteorologists simulate and predict monthly high Fahrenheit and Celsius temperatures here in Charlotte, NC.</p>
    <p>According to <a href="https://www.usclimatedata.com/climate/charlotte/north-carolina/united-states/usnc0121">usclimatedata.com</a>, 
      in 2023, Charlotte had the following average monthly high Fahrenheit temperatures:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>January</td>
        <td>51.0&deg; F</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>February</td>
        <td>55.0&deg; F</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>March</td>
        <td>63.0&deg; F</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>April</td>
        <td>72.0&deg; F</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>May</td>
        <td>79.0&deg; F</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>June</td>
        <td>86.0&deg; F</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>July</td>
        <td>89.0&deg; F</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>August</td>
        <td>87.0&deg; F</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>September</td>
        <td>81.0&deg; F</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>October</td>
        <td>72.0&deg; F</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>November</td>
        <td>62.0&deg; F</td>

    <p>
      Code a modular program that uses parallel arrays to store the monthly average high monthly Fahrenheit temperatures for Charlotte in 2023, 
      randomly generated average high monthly Fahrenheit temperatures based on the 2023 average monthly temperatures and calculated monthly high 
      Celsius temperatures based on the randomly generated average high monthly Fahrenheit temperatures. 
    </p>
    <p>The program must do the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The program must have an array of type <b>double</b> named <b>average2023FTemperatures</b> that stores the monthly average high monthly 
        Fahrenheit temperatures for Charlotte in 2023. Use an initialization list to store the values mentioned above.
      </li>
      <li>
        The program must have an array of type <b>double</b> named <b>genAverageFTemperatures</b> that stores the randomly generated monthly high Fahrenheit temperatures for the predictive analysis. 
        Use a loop to populate the array by calling the <b>generateRandFahrenheitTemp()</b> function (function details below) and pass in each temperature from the <b>average2023FTemperatures</b> array.
      </li>
      <li>
        The program must have an array of type <b>double</b> named <b>averageCTemperatures</b> that stores the calculated monthly high Celsius temperatures for the predictive analysis. 
        Use a loop to populate the array by calling the <b>calcCelsiusTemp()</b> function (function details below) and pass in each temperature from the genAverageFTemperatures array.
      </li>
      <li>
        The program must have a variable of type <b>double</b> named <b>meanFahrenheitTemp</b> that holds the calculated mean monthly Fahrenheit temperature using the array of generated monthly 
        Fahrenheit temperatures, <b>genAverageFTemperatures</b>. This value must be calculated by calling the <b>calcMean()</b> function (function details below) and passing in the <b>genAverageFTemperatures</b> array.
      </li>
      <li>
        The program must have a variable of type <b>double</b> named <b>meanCelsiusTemp</b> that holds the calculated mean monthly Celsius temperature using the array of calculated monthly Celsius 
        temperatures, <b>averageCTemperatures</b>. This value must be calculated by calling the <b>calcMean()</b> function (function details below) and passing in the <b>averageCTemperatures</b> array.
      </li>
    </ol>
