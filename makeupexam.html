      <br>
    </ol>
    <p>In addition to the main() function, declare prototypes, write function definitions, and correctly call the following functions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        generateRandFahrenheitTemp() – This is a <b>double</b>-returning function that must generate and return a random monthly average Fahrenheit temperature based on an 
        average monthly Fahrenheit temperature. <b>This function must accept a parameter of type double that represents an average monthly Fahrenheit temperature.</b> The 
        function must randomly generate and return a value that is between +3 and -3 degrees based on the value of the parameter.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        calcCelsisusTemp() – This is a <b>double</b>-returning function that must calculate and return a Celsius temperature based on a Fahrenheit temperature. <b>This function 
        must accept a parameter of type double that represents an average monthly Fahrenheit temperature.</b> To calculate a Celsius temperature, use the following formula: 
        <i><b>Celsius Temperature = (Fahrenheit Temperature - 32) * (5.0 / 9.0)</b></i>. The function must use the value of the parameter to calculate and return 
        the value of the Celsius temperature.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        calcMean() – This is a <b>double</b>-returning function that must calculate the arithmetic mean of monthly average high temperatures. <b>This function must accept an array 
        of type double of monthly average high temperatures and an integer value that represents that represents the number of months in a year as parameters</b>. To calculate 
        the arithmetic mean, do the following: declare a <b>double</b> variable named <b>total</b> that will hold a running total of temperatures and initialize the value to <b>0.0</b>, then 
        calculate the total by looping through the array of monthly average high temperatures and add each temperature to the running total, then calculate and return the 
        arithmetic mean as: <i><b>(running total / number of months)</b></i>.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        calcVariance() – This is a <b>double</b>-returning function that must calculate the variance of monthly average high temperatures. <b>This function must accept an array of 
        type double of monthly average high temperatures, an integer value that represents that represents the number of months in a year as parameters, and a value of type 
        double that represents the arithmetic mean high average of monthly temperatures</b>. To calculate the variance, do the following: declare an array of type <b>double</b> based 
        on the number of months to hold the calculated deviations, then populate the deviations array by looping through the array of temperatures and subtract the mean from 
        the monthly average high temperature, then declare another array of type <b>double</b> to hold the squared deviations, then populate the squared deviations array by looping 
        through the array of deviations and squaring each deviation <i><b>(deviation * deviation)</b></i>, then declare a variable of type <b>double</b> to hold the sum of the squared deviations 
        and initialize the value to <b>0.0</b>, then calculate the sum of the squared deviations by looping through the array of squared deviations and adding each value to the sum 
        of the squared deviations, then return the sum of squared deviations / number of months.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        calcStandardDeviation() – This is a <b>double</b>-returning function that must calculate and return the standard deviation of the variance. <b>This function must accept a 
        double representing the variance as a parameter</b>. The function then must call the sqrt() function to calculate and return the standard deviation of the variance. 
        <b>NOTE: include the &lt;cmath&gt; header to enable the use of the sqrt() (square root) function</b>.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        calcZScores() – This is a <b>void</b> function that displays the values of the monthly average high temperatures and calculates and displays their corresponding Z-scores. 
        <b>This function must accept an array of type double of average high monthly temperatures, an integer that represents the number of months, a double that represents 
        the arithmetic mean of average high monthly temperatures, a double that represents the standard deviation of average high monthly temperatures, and a character 
        indicating whether the temperatures are Fahrenheit (‘F’) or Celsius (‘C’)</b>. Z-scores are calculated by taking a raw score, subtracting the mean, then dividing by the 
        standard deviation. In this function, first declare an array of type <b>double</b> to hold the Z-score for each monthly average high temperature. Then, use a loop to populate 
        the array of Z-scores by looping through each temperature, subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (Z-score = (temperature – mean) / standard deviation). 
        Then use a loop to display each average monthly high temperature, degree symbol <b>(NOTE: use “\370” to show the degree symbol)</b>, temperature type (‘F’ or ‘C’), and calculated 
        Z-score on each line. Refer to the sample run videos below to see how the outputs can look.
